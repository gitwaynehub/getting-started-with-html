<h1>HTML Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. Users on computers with web browsers (is FOX, Safari, Chrome....) connect to web server host via the internet. Web server host contain HTML files which are sent back to the users when requestd.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".</p>

<b>Tags</b>
<p>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag. </p>

<b>Elements</b>
<p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page, once this has been parsed into the Document Object Model. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified.</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are only as smart as the programs that it contains.  One's and Zero's.  They take code literaly.  Any errors in coding make the pomputer to stupid.
</p>

<b>Inline Block Elements</b>
<p>You can create a grid of boxes that fills the browser width and wraps nicely. This has been possible for a long time using float , but now with <em>inline-block</em> it's even easier. <em> Inline-block </em> elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and height. </p>

<b>Block Elements</b>
<p>A block level element that can be used as a container for other HTML elements. The element has no special meaning. It has no required attributes, but style and class are common. Because it is a block level element, the browser will display line breaks before and after it. </p>
